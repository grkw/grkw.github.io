- Impossible day pairing on linux kernel modules @**Piya** @**Stephen**
- Some feedback and much-needed encouragement about Open When @**Bradley**
- Pairing with @**Sophia**  on 3 past Leetle problems

## Weds

- pairing with @**Priya** to figure out why my React component wasn't showing up... it's because I didn't use good coding practices oops

## Fri

- watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMq0vncHJvU&list=PL4isNRKAwz2O9FxP97_EbOivIWWwSWt5j) other local-first conf presentation and planning to incorporate local-first principles into openwhen
- really enjoyed chatting with @**Jesse** this morning. added some subreddits to my RSS feed (really love [Unread](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/), thank you so much for the rec @**Daniel**  -- this is exactly what I've been looking for)
- caught up on more of the January Leetles (just 1 more I need to catch up on). it's actually making leetcode kind of fun??
- got a really nice review on openwhen from @**Marc Anthony** and nice chats with @**Kevin** @**Maura**

generally took today slow because I had been grinding the past few days to publish v1 of [openwhen](https://www.openwhen.site/). also because this afternoon, i got rejected from the summer internship i was interviewing for and am bummed from that, was hoping i could be done with recruiting but i guess it wasn't meant to be. perhaps something better will come along ("sometimes good things fall apart so that better things can come together" :vomit: hahaha). it's also a bit destabilizing because i felt somewhat confident i'd get the role but i was wrong -- and now, for grad school admissions I also feel somewhat confident i'll get into at least one school and i might be wrong. and i know, i know, life is all about pivoting and making your next best move ("god laughs at plans" and "a tree that can never bend will break") but like, i try *so* hard to go get the things i really want and i'm so tired of the universe saying nope nope nope :smiling_face_with_tear: but that's not fair, it does say yes sometimes and that's what i have to focus on otherwise i end up writing check-ins like this haha
