Almost done with Open When. The last thing is I want to implement my own backend using Django or something so that I actually know what's going on in backend (SQL? servers? huh?)! And also how to make it have more local-first principles. We'll see.

I see other recursers do way cooler stuff than me during batch but I think it's because they came in with a lot more experience than I did. Or maybe they're just better than me and that's fine too lol

## Thurs

- pairing with @**Russell** to debug my react issue with opening letters
- presentations â€” want to look into cloud flare @**Nolen**  and iOS peer to peer @**Aparna**

## Fri

- pairing with @**Farid Rener** chatting about backend and robotics
- volition and your career workshop with @**Nate**  @**Priya**  @**Jakub**
- pairing with @**Sam** catching up about our batch, doing leetcode, talking about creative writing
