## Mon

- Made [openwhen](https://www.openwhen.site/) look good on mobile thanks to @**Priya** and @**Jesse**  and fixed some bugs

## Tues

- thank you @_**Laura** for your advice on looking for summer swe internships!
- Half-baked demos
- A very nice chat with @**Russell**
- Leetle with @**Bradley**

## Weds

- thank you again @_**Laura**
- Made my [GitHub](https://github.com/grkw) profile as recruiting-ready as I could (added readme’s to my git repo, added a profile readme)
- Same for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-j-kwak/), [personal website](https://gracekwak.me/), resume

Realized I might be getting rejected from PhD internships because I’m competing against students who are actually currently enrolled and more senior PhD students. And I might be getting rejected from undergrad internships because I’m no longer in undergrad and also the undergrad internship recruiting season was last autumn haha

## Thurs

- Pairing on 2 Leetles with @**Daniel** . Today's was very difficult and I felt validated that we both found it difficult. Learned a few great python debugging tips:`input()` function: wait take input from stdin and can use as breakpoints haha, `-i` flag: to run scripts in a repl
- Tried implementing a more robust user flow for opening letters and realized my code is just too much of a mess to work with so switched to cleaning up the code -- plus I want the code to be recruiting-ready anyway. Got about halfway through!

## Fri

- Paired with @**Sherry**  on a few Leetles (including [queue reconstruction by height](https://leetle.app/?date=2025-01-29)!!!!! ft. @**Nolen**)
- Finished cleaning up Open When code so that I could finally start fixing the user flow for opening letters.
