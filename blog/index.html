        <p>I like to write. When it comes to personal matters, I've found that the act of writing <i>saves me from myself</i> in a way that nothing else can (hence the title of this blog: Saving Grace).</p>
        <p>My day-to-day writing is spread across my computer's hard drive, my brain's memory, my physical journals + letters, and myriad messaging apps. Most of it is ephemera that I won't bother to upload here but every so often, I surprise myself with words of wisdom that I want to keep for my future self and share with readers like you.</p>
        <p>Here are some of those words.</p>
        <p>(Actually, I might include some ephemera in this blog too, just because.)</p>
