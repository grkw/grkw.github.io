## The I In the Internet

- the internet determining, rather than reflecting, the worst of modern life
  - hashtag design has shaped so much of political discourse

### The infinite scroll

- it is essential that social media is mostly unsatisfying. that is what keeps us scrolling
- no limit to the amount of misfortune a person could take in via the internet

### Uniformity and streamlining and context collapse

- no way to teach ourselves to separate the banal from the profound

### Personal branding

- **We have to have our dark corners and the unexplained**
- online, your audience can hypothetically keep expanding forever, and the performance never has to end
- actual selfhood embraces culpability, inconsistency, and insignificance

### The assumption that speech has an impact

- the assumption that speech has an impact, that it's something like action; the assumption that it's fine or helpful or even ideal to be constantly writing down what you think
- people wrote about women "speaking out" with prayerful reverence, as if speech itself could bring women freedom — as if better policies and economic redistribution and true investment from men weren't necessary, too.
- **the representation of an activity will vary in some degree from the activity itself and therefore inevitably misrepresent it**
- both-sides arguments like this are always appealing to people who wish to seem both contrarian and intellectually superior

### Toxic and extremist internet communities

- rather than work toward other forms of self-actualization, they established a group identity that centered on anti-woman virulence
- credit women with a maximum of power that they did not actually possess
- **#yesallwomen not all men have made women fearful, but yes, all women have experienced fear because of men**
- feminist solidarity and shared vulnerability inextricable, as if we were incapable of building solidarity around anything else

## Reality TV Me

- ordinary personhood would seamlessly readjust itself around whatever within it would sell
- **too conscious of what "Jia" would do in this situation — that I'm in danger of becoming a "character to myself"**
- "I don't want to get famous for this bullshit. I want to get famous for writing a book."

## Always Be Optimizing

- **the ideal woman always believes she came up with herself on her own**
- **he needs to eat his twelve-dollar salad in ten minutes because he needs the extra time to keep functioning within the job that allows him to afford a regular twelve-dollar salad in the first place. he feels a physical need for this twelve-dollar salad as it's the most reliable and convenient way to build up a vitamin barrier against the general malfunction that comes with his salad-requiring-and-enabling job**
- imagining beauty as a matter of hard work and entrepreneurship, the American Dream
- the logic of beauty as an ethical ideal
- Glossier — idealize beauty that appears to require almost no intervention
- the default assumption is that it is politically important to designate everyone as beautiful
- instead of trying to be more radiant for our husbands, we can now counsel one another to do all the same things but for ourselves
- relentless self-improvement as natural, mandatory, and feminist — or just, without question, the best way to live
- "enclothed cognition" clothes that come with cultural scripts can actually alter cognitive functions
- the best way to instill a cultural value is to eroticize it
- we pay too much for the things we think are precious, but we also start to believe things are precious if someone makes us pay too much
- there are rewards for succeeding under capitalism and patriarchy
- **we have not "optimized" our wages, our childcare system, our political representation**
- it's possible if we want it. but what do we want?

## Pure Heroines

- stories are episodic rather than accumulative, and so sadness and fear are rooms to be passed through, existing alongside mishap and indulgence and joy
- a wedding signifies the end of individual desire
- their desires evolve to fit their life
- because the girls are not allowed to socialize, the boys observe them not as peers but as dolls in a display case — The Virgin Suicides
- just because the question can be answered doesn't mean that I ought to answer it, or that it ought to be asked. the interviewer's question presumed that women should have children, and that a woman's reproductive activities were naturally public business. more fundamentally, the question assumed that there was only one proper way for a woman to live."
- heroes are mostly unhappy for existential reasons; heroines suffer for social reasons, because of male power

## Ecstasy

- it's hard to draw the line between taking pleasure in God's purpose and aligning God's purpose with what I take pleasure in

## The Story of a Generation in Seven Scams

- the basic idea here is that photogenic personal confidence is the key to unlocking the riches of the world
- a feminism that prioritizes the individual will always, at its core, be at odds with a feminism that prioritizes the collective
- **whenever women and minorities are allowed to be their own Bezos, it will hardly be a victory for anyone at all**

## We Come from Old Virginia

- would have cast doubts upon my masculinity
- institutions, by definition, are not natural or primal. they are _not_ just what happens when you let boys be boys. they are created and sustained for a reason. they do work.

## The Cult of the Difficult Woman

- "feminist coverage" = fair coverage
- the line between valuing a woman in the face of mistreatment and valuing her because of that mistreatment is blurring, if it's possible to praise a woman specifically because she is criticized
- **to argue against an ideology, you have to acknowledge and articulate it**
- their success is forever refracted through those obstacles
- a displeasure at the lack of unruliness, at the disappointment of watching women adhere to the most predictable guidelines of what a woman should be
- **the freedom I want is located in a world where we wouldn't _need_ to love women**
- where female difficulty now seems perverse, the refusal of difficulty now seems perverse

## I Thee Dread

- weddings are frequently slanted as the most special day of _her_ life, if not necessarily his
- woman lies in wait
- she becomes less happy than she would be if she was single
- ring to signify male ownership
- the person who will invest most in this process is the bride to be
- **what are we all ever doing except playing a part that fulfills a role at its appropriate time?**
- when I curled up to him in the mornings I felt like a baby sea lion climbing on a sunlit rock
- careers taking priority over their spouse's careers
- we find it inappropriate for women to treat their names the way that men, by default, feel entitled to
- **a woman is allowed to assert her independence as long as it doesn't affect anyone else**
- like any social construct, marriage is most flexible when it is new (gay couples)
- I wonder if women would accept the unequal diminishment of their independence without their sense of self-importance being overinflated first
- in the end, the safest conclusions may not actually be conclusions
- **I have always accommodated everything I wish I was opposed to**
