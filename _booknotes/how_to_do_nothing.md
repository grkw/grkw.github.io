title: "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy by Jenny Odell"
permalink: /how_to_do_nothing

- something like a collage is at the heart of the unstable and highly personal process of perception
- how endlessly strange reality is when we look at it rather than through it
- I-Thou recognizes the irreducibility and absolute equality of the other
- But if you've really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, loud, slow, consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars â€” compassion, love, the sub-surface unity of all things.
- reality is blobby. it refuses to be systematized.
- when I worry that no one will see the value of these murky waters, it is also a worry that I will be stripped of my own unsuable parts, my own mysteries, and my own depths.
- I have thrown away my lantern, and I can see the dark.
