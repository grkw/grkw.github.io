        <h3>Meditation</h3>
		<p> In September 2023, I participated in <a href="https://www.spiritrock.org/">Spirit Rock</a>’s “Foundations of Mindfulness,” a 5-day silent meditation retreat. Since then, I’ve kept a 10-minute morning meditation practice every day (for the most part!).</p>
		<h3>Cross-training</h3>
		<p> I found CrossFit almost by accident. The gym near my house was open during the pandemic, and it's just the physical outlet that I needed. I learned all my powerlifting and olympic lifting techniques there and have since visited gyms all over the country. Here's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRAi6hslBxS/">me doing my favorite CrossFit workout</a>, which happens to be called “Grace” (30 clean + jerks for time)! </p>
		<h3>Running</h3>
		<p>I ran track & field and cross country when I was in grade school, and it's been part of me ever since. Follow me on Strava. </p>
		<h3>Sex education</h3>
		<p>Over the 2020 pandemic, I taught 3 (unofficial) sex education workshops to high schoolers via Zoom!</p>
