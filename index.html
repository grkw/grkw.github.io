  		<h1>Grace Kwak</h1>
		<p>I'm a CS PhD applicant interested in generalizable, data-efficient robotic intelligence via compositional and hierarchical learned models. I want to help push the boundaries of robotic intelligence to unlock their potential to make work safer, more efficient, and more impactful â€“ ultimately improving the quality of life for people across the world. </p>
		<p> I graduated from <a href="https://ucla.edu/">UCLA</a> with a B.S. Electrical Engineering in June 2024 as a Regents Scholar. As an undergrad, I was involved in the <a href="https://vectr-ucla.github.io/">Verifiable & Control-Theoretic Robotics Laboratory</a> under Professor Brett Lopez. I've previously been at <a href="https://www.flyzipline.com/">Zipline</a> and <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/">Blue Origin</a> in guidance, navigation, and control (GNC). More about me is on my CV. </p>
		<p> Over the pandemic, I wrote and published <a href="amzn.to/3epmnvz">The Glitch (New Degree Press)</a>, which is available in paperback and e-book. </p>
