# Grace Kwak

I'm a CS PhD applicant interested in generalizable, data-efficient robotic intelligence via compositional and hierarchical learned models. I want to help push the boundaries of robotic intelligence to unlock their potential to make work safer, more efficient, and more impactful â€“ ultimately improving the quality of life for people across the world.

I graduated from [UCLA](https://ucla.edu/) with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in June 2024 as a Regents Scholar. As an undergrad, I was involved in the [Verifiable & Control-Theoretic Robotics Laboratory](https://vectr-ucla.github.io/) under Professor Brett Lopez. I've previously been at [Zipline](https://www.flyzipline.com/) and [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/) in guidance, navigation, and control (GNC). More about me is on my CV.

Over the pandemic, I wrote and published [*The Glitch* (New Degree Press)](https://www.amazon.com/Glitch-Novel-Grace-Kwak/dp/1637306857?qid=&sr=), which is available in paperback and e-book.
