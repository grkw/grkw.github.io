# Grace Kwak

I'm a robotics+ML researcher interested in generalizable, data-efficient robotic intelligence via compositional learned models. I want to unlock the potential for robots to make work safer, more efficient, and more impactful in essential industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and logistics.

I'm currently on a gap year, where I'm taking the time to explore my interests at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) while applying to PhD programs in CS. I graduated from [UCLA](https://ucla.edu/) with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in June 2024 as a Regents Scholar. As an undergrad, I developed a learning-enabled motion primitive sampler for a long-horizon planner in the [Verifiable & Control-Theoretic Robotics Laboratory](https://vectr-ucla.github.io/) under Professor Brett Lopez. I've recently been a controls engineering intern at [Zipline](https://www.flyzipline.com/) and [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/).

Over the pandemic, I wrote and published [*The Glitch* (New Degree Press)](https://www.amazon.com/Glitch-Novel-Grace-Kwak/dp/1637306857?qid=&sr=), which is available in paperback and e-book.

**Papers that I'm excited about:**
- [Compositional Generative Modeling: A Single Model is Not All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01103)
- [Planning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09991)
- [Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08587)
