# With great privilege comes great responsibility

This page is a work in progress. The idea is that I want to turn my anger into action, and one of the joys of having a website is that it's available all the time, everywhere.

Here's a quote I absolutely love:

> To the privileged, equality feels like oppression.

It explains all the backlash against social justice movements (and it makes total sense). It helps me extend compassion and understanding to people to have privileges that I don't have (and help me embrace not getting something that I previously took for granted).

## How to be a good ally

- The Recurse Center has an amazing culture of programmers, and they have these [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules).
- Split [glue work](https://www.noidea.dog/glue) evenly amongst team members.
- [Be a sponsor, not a mentor](https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/)

## Privilege

I love Sam Killerman's articles about privilege, which all start with "It’s not about shame. It’s about understanding".

Here's "a letter to all the white, straight, cisgender, man people out there — people like myself — who are struggling with the idea of being told to "check your privilege": [Dear White, Straight, Cisgender, Man People: You Are Privileged](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2014/05/dear-white-straight-cisgender-men-privilege/)

I would love if all the men in my life read (and thoughtfully processed) these examples of [male privilege](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/) as a start.

[Cisgender privileges](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/list-of-cisgender-privileges/) that I hold.

[Middle-to-Upper Class Privileges](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/list-of-upperclass-privilege/) that I hold.

## Gender

This section focuses on women and men for now, but I want to make it include the experiences of non-binary people too.

- [Stereotype threat is real](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/picture-yourself-as-a-stereotypical-male/)
- [Unlocking the Clubhouse](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17WuN6UJ_G3c23cqTv3O6sevIaGAsBA-U/view?usp=sharing) validated a lot of my experiences as a "woman engineer"
- [Girl Boss Feminism: What Is It and Why We Should Avoid It at All Costs?](https://femonomic.com/girl-boss-feminism-what-is-it-and-why-we-should-avoid-it-at-all-costs/)

### Random

- [Shirt for women that says "Engineer"](https://manwhohasitallshop.com/product/engineer-top/Black) and [shirt for men that says "Male Engineer"](https://manwhohasitallshop.com/product/male-engineer-t-shirt-5caa53d6e775b/). *Awesome*
