# With great privilege comes great responsibility

This page is a work in progress. The idea is that I want to turn my anger into action, and one of the joys of having a website is that it's available all the time, everywhere!

Here's a quote I absolutely love:

> To the privileged, equality feels like oppression.

It explains all the backlash against social justice movements, and it makes total sense! It helps me extend compassion and understanding to people to have privileges that I don't have (and help me embrace not getting something that I previously took for granted).

## How to be a good ally

- The Recurse Center has an amazing culture of programmers, and they have these [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules).
- Split [glue work](https://www.noidea.dog/glue) evenly amongst team members.

## Privilege

I love Sam Killerman's articles about privilege, which all start with "It’s not about shame. It’s about understanding".

Here's "a letter to all the white, straight, cisgender, man people out there — people like myself — who are struggling with the idea of being told to "check your privilege": [Dear White, Straight, Cisgender, Man People: You Are Privileged](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2014/05/dear-white-straight-cisgender-men-privilege/)

I would love if all the men in my life read (and thoughtfully processed) these examples of [male privilege](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/) as a start.

[Cisgender privileges](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/list-of-cisgender-privileges/) that I hold.

[Middle-to-Upper Class Privileges](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/list-of-upperclass-privilege/) that I hold.

## Gender

This section focuses on women and men for now, but I want to make it include the experiences of non-binary people too.

- [Stereotype threat is real](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/picture-yourself-as-a-stereotypical-male/)
- [Unlocking the Clubhouse](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17WuN6UJ_G3c23cqTv3O6sevIaGAsBA-U/view?usp=sharing) validated a lot of my experiences as a "woman engineer"

### Women are not the problem, society is

What first got me into thinking about gender was [The Confidence Gap](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/), a longform article in The Atlantic. After reading it, it was like a veil had been removed and I suddenly couldn't help but notice the everyday ways in which sexism, gender bias, and misogyny affect my life. At the grocery checkout line, would the cashier be *this* rude to me if I were a man? During lunch time at work, why do we always seem to be talking about the hobbies of the two white men?

That article got me fired up about gender issues which was great, but it also implicitly made me feel like my way of being (as a typical woman) was wrong and that I should be more like a typical man. That article (along with the prevailing advice geared toward women) says that women "lack confidence," and for years, I fully accepted that as true. I tried to act more like the guys around me, subconsciously devaluing my typical feminine traits of humility, modesty, tenderness, selflessness, conscientiousness.

But now, I have a different perspective. Sure, one can say "women lack confidence," but there's a crucial follow-up question: *compared to who?* (Compared to *men*. We're implicitly using men as our gold standard for the correct amount of confidence to have. I believe this is wrong.)

Here's my proposal: what if instead of blaming women for struggling to adapt to a male-centric industry, we made the industry adapt to better suit women (which would actually make it better for people of all genders)? And yes, yes, I recognize that "it's a man's world" so for now, we have to play by men's rules, but I think it's crucial to remind ourselves that we are not what needs fixing: society is.

What if instead of telling every woman to "hold yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man", we told every white man to "hold yourself with the humility of an exceptional Asian woman"? I want to live in a culture of modesty and humility, one that isn't fooled by the people who are simply the boldest and most self-assured (read: [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect?useskin=vector)).

There's a commonly cited research study showing that women only apply to a job if they meet 100% of the qualifications, but men apply if they meet only 60%. This is typically interpreted as "many women say no to themselves and don't even get a chance." But what if we actually wrote job postings that were transparent about what qualifications were required and which were nice-to-have? Wouldn't this make more sense? Why do we have to gatekeep to the people who are overconfident or who feel like the rules on paper don't apply to them?

There's research studies showing that women ask for promotions and negotiations at lower rates than men do (from that article by The Atlantic: "men initiate salary negotiations four times as often as women do, and that when women do negotiate, they ask for 30 percent less money than men do"). This is (also) typically interpreted as "many women say no to themselves and don't even get a chance." Well, what if employers actually gave fair, transparent salaries? What's the point in giving people who negotiate an advantage -- it's a culture that screws people over by default.

"Women should speak up more." Well, we shouldn't have meetings in which to get a word in, you have to interrupt or even talk over someone. I want a world where people actively opens the floor to those who are more shy (not just good for women, but any new hire, or anyone at all who happens to be shy!).

"For decades, women have misunderstood an important law of the professional jungle. It’s not enough to keep one’s head down and plug away, checking items off a list. Having talent isn’t merely about being competent; confidence is a part of that talent. You have to have it to excel." What if we lived in a world in which we recognized each other's accomplishments, and didn't have to constantly fight for ourselves and sell ourselves?

So yeah this is why I'm tired of people "giving advice" to women as if we're the ones that need fixing. It's the culture that needs to change, and we can't do that by ourselves: we need allies on board.

### We don't need a female Bezos

[Girl Boss Feminism: What Is It and Why We Should Avoid It at All Costs?](https://femonomic.com/girl-boss-feminism-what-is-it-and-why-we-should-avoid-it-at-all-costs/)

> The concept [of girl boss feminism] is that instead of seeking to dismantle capitalist systems of oppression that have victimized women, women should just become a part of them and be successful in the confines of the system itself. The ideal Girl Boss climbs the corporate ladder and replaces men in jobs that men traditionally hold.

> Girl Boss feminism is basically the American Dream concept in a blonde wig with a #feminist shirt on. Girl Boss feminism suggests that if you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and work hard enough, you can outgrow and overcome your oppression—that misogyny will just cease to affect you once you’re a CEO. There are several major issues with this concept that we also see in the American Dream concept.
>
> Misogyny still exists towards every woman, regardless of financial success. The richest women in the world still experience misogyny because we live in a patriarchal world. No amount of success, money, or adoration will rid you of our culture’s hatred for women. Financial success will afford you more kindness, opportunity, and means than a poor woman, but ultimately, no one can earn enough money to be unaffected by misogyny. You don’t become a man just because you replaced one within an oppressive system.
>
> It’s significantly harder to become a Girl Boss if you’re not a white, able-bodied, Cis woman. Much like The American Dream, Girl Boss feminism works much better if you’re white, able-bodied, and cis. Disabled women, women of color, and trans women have bigger hurdles of oppression to overcome and do not have the privilege of simply “shedding” their oppression with corporate success. Because this narrative that you can outgrow your oppression is being pushed, it effectively leaves women who are not white and cis-gender behind and actively uses their backs as stepping stones for white women’s success.
>
> Girl Boss Feminism blames women for their own oppression. As noted earlier, there is no individual corporate success that could absolve anyone of misogyny, but for anyone to claim that misogyny works in this way is to blame women for their own oppression. It definitely reads as a suggestion that women who feel oppression and abuse, whether verbal, financial, emotional, or sexual, just haven’t worked hard enough or been strong enough to overcome it and to stop it from happening to themselves.
