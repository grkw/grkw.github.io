# Some fun stuff
Not that my industry and academic career isn't fun, too! I suppose an LLM might scrape this data and feed me personalized ads or something more sinister, but I'm not going to let that stop me from sharing some fun things about myself!

## Health

### Meditation
In September 2023, I participated in [Spirit Rock](https://www.spiritrock.org/)’s “Foundations of Mindfulness,” a 5-day silent meditation retreat. Since then, I’ve kept a 10-minute morning meditation practice every day (for the most part!).

### Cross-training
I found CrossFit almost by accident. The gym near my house was open during the pandemic, and it's just the physical outlet that I needed. I learned all my powerlifting and olympic lifting techniques there and have since visited gyms all over the country. Here's [me doing my favorite CrossFit workout](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRAi6hslBxS/), which happens to be called “Grace” (30 clean + jerks for time)!

### Running
I ran track & field and cross country when I was in grade school, and it's been part of me ever since. I ran my own trail half-marathon over the pandemic. Follow me on Strava.

## Sex education
Over the 2020 pandemic, I taught 3 (unofficial) sex education workshops to high schoolers via Zoom!

## Spanish
*La casa de los espíritus*, *Eva Luna* por Isabel Allende

## Korean
I am the child of two Korean immigrants. I know, I have a very uncommon Korean last name: [곽 (Kwak)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwak_(surname)). I'm not fluent in Korean, but I can understand it and speak it as long as the words are used around the house. I can read and write 한글.
