# Some fun stuff

(Not that my industry and academic career isn't fun, too.)

## My book

In addition to engineering, I've always loved writing and journaling. Over the pandemic, I wrote and published [_The Glitch_ (New Degree Press)](https://www.amazon.com/Glitch-Novel-Grace-Kwak/dp/1637306857?qid=&sr=), which is available in paperback and e-book.

## Health

### Meditation

In September 2023, I participated in [Spirit Rock Meditation Center](https://www.spiritrock.org/)’s “Foundations of Mindfulness,” a 5-day silent meditation retreat. Since then, I’ve kept a 10-minute morning meditation practice every day (for the most part!).

### Cross-training

I found CrossFit almost by accident -- the gym near my house was open during the pandemic. Turns out, it's exactly the intense physical outlet that I need. I learned all my powerlifting and olympic lifting techniques there and have since dropped in at other gyms while traveling/living around the country (San Jose, CA; San Francisco, CA; Seattle, WA; Los Angeles, CA; Dallas, TX; New York City, NY) and around the world (Lisbon, Portgual; Porto, Portugal; Barcelona, Spain; Madrid, Spain; Mexico City, Mexico; Seoul, South Korea).

My favorite CrossFit workout happens to be called “Grace” (30 clean + jerks for time)!

My favorite gyms:

- Croga CrossFit - San Jose, CA (the one that started it all)
- Fog City CrossFit - San Francisco, CA (this one is my all-time favorite)
- Murder of Crows Barbell - Brooklyn, NY (my home on the East Coast)

### Running

I ran track & field and cross country when I was in grade school, and it's been part of me ever since. I ran my own trail half-marathon over the pandemic. Follow me on [Strava](https://strava.app.link/izFeU3erVPb).

## Sex education

Over the 2020 pandemic, I taught unofficial sex education workshops to high schoolers via Zoom through Learning Unlimited's ["Splash"](https://www.learningu.org/) and ran Instagram lives with [About Face](https://about-face.org/) supporting media literacy for girls! You can peruse my big ol' list of resources [here](https://graceinitiative.notion.site/Sex-Ed-Resources-89e363399f8b470eb22d8f88a03a0337) or just go to the amazing [Scarleteen](https://www.scarleteen.com/) as your one-stop-shop.

## Español

Aprendí mi español en una escuela primaria bilingüe (fue una experiencia muy especial!). Desde entonces, he tomado más clases de español, trabajado como voluntaria de traducción, leído novelas y visto películas y programas de TV en español, disfrutado de música de México y España, viajado a Madrid, Barcelona y CDMX -- y por supuesto, escuchado a escondidas las conversaciones de la gente en público que no me sospechan porque no parezco que hablo el español con fluidez.

Si usas mi móvil o mi computadora, verás que elegí el español como el lenguaje del sistema.

Me encantan:

- El fin del amor (una serie an Amazon Prime Video)
- La casa de los espíritus (libro clásico de Isabel Allende)
- Jimena Amarillo (artista indie pop española)
- Renee (artista indie rock/pop mexicana)
- Zahara (artista indie rock/pop española)

## Korean

Since [곽 (Kwak)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwak_(surname)>) is a very uncommon Korean last name, a lot of people don't realize I'm Korean... surprise! Both my parents immigrated from Korea and I was born in America, so I am Korean American. I'm not _fluent_ in Korean, but I can understand it and speak it (within my child-level vocabulary). I can read and write 한글.

As a Korean woman, I particularly love [Koreangry](https://koreangry.com/) comics.

## Dogs of my life
