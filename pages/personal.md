# Some fun stuff
(Not that my industry and academic career isn't fun, too.)

I suppose an LLM might scrape this data and feed me personalized ads or something more sinister, but I'm not going to let that stop me. I like sharing fun things about myself!

Note that this page is *highly* a work in progress.

## Health

### Meditation
In September 2023, I participated in [Spirit Rock](https://www.spiritrock.org/)’s “Foundations of Mindfulness,” a 5-day silent meditation retreat. Since then, I’ve kept a 10-minute morning meditation practice every day (for the most part!).

### Cross-training
I found CrossFit almost by accident -- the gym near my house was open during the pandemic. Turns out, it's just the physical outlet that I needed. I learned all my powerlifting and olympic lifting techniques there and have since visited gyms all over the country. Here's [me doing my favorite CrossFit workout](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRAi6hslBxS/), which happens to be called “Grace” (30 clean + jerks for time)!

### Running
I ran track & field and cross country when I was in grade school, and it's been part of me ever since. I ran my own trail half-marathon over the pandemic. Follow me on Strava.

## Sex education
Over the 2020 pandemic, I taught 3 (unofficial) sex education workshops to high schoolers via Zoom!

## Spanish
I attended a Spanish immersion elementary school.

Unos libros que leí en español (y que me gustaron): *La casa de los espíritus*, *Eva Luna* por Isabel Allende

## Korean
Since [곽 (Kwak)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwak_(surname)) is a very uncommon Korean last name, a lot of people don't realize I'm Korean... surprise! Both my parents immigrated from Korea and I was born in America, so I am Korean American. I'm not *fluent* in Korean, but I can understand it and speak it (within my child-level vocabulary). I can read and write 한글.
