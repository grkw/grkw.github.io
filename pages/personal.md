# Some fun stuff (not that my industry and academic career isn't fun, too!)

## Health

### Meditation
In September 2023, I participated in [Spirit Rock](https://www.spiritrock.org/)’s “Foundations of Mindfulness,” a 5-day silent meditation retreat. Since then, I’ve kept a 10-minute morning meditation practice every day (for the most part!).

### Cross-training
I found CrossFit almost by accident. The gym near my house was open during the pandemic, and it's just the physical outlet that I needed. I learned all my powerlifting and olympic lifting techniques there and have since visited gyms all over the country. Here's [me doing my favorite CrossFit workout](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRAi6hslBxS/), which happens to be called “Grace” (30 clean + jerks for time)!

### Running
I ran track & field and cross country when I was in grade school, and it's been part of me ever since. Follow me on Strava.

### Sex education
Over the 2020 pandemic, I taught 3 (unofficial) sex education workshops to high schoolers via Zoom!
