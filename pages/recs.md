### Other

- Reebok Nano (training shoes)
- [Lunette menstrual cup](https://store.lunette.com/): super soft and comfy for both lounging and exercising, chemical-free medical-grade silicone, never have to buy pads/tampons, only have to empty it every 8 hours, cost-effective and eco-friendly in the long run (saves over $100/year by not buying disposable products and I've had mine since 2017!)
- [Thinx period underwear](https://www.thinx.com/): also super soft and comfy, cost-effective and eco-friendly in the long run, a reasonable amount of absorption capacity, a nice backup for when I don't have my menstrual cup handy or an alternative on light days
