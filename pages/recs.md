Giving a shout-out to some stuff that I love and that I want more people to know about!

## Tech

### Apps

- [Arc browser](https://arc.net/): a web browser with the UI I was looking for to stay focused and organized on the internet (though it is Chrome-based)
- [Unhook](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid): Chrome extension that removes YouTube recommended and shorts
- [Minimal LinkedIn](https://github.com/cindywu/minimal-linkedin): a Chrome extension that blocks the cluttery content
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): a simple, infinitely customizable Markdown-based text editor
- [Warp](https://warp.dev/): a terminal with block-based UI for commands; it just makes sense!
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/): a to-do app that has helped me stay organized since I was in high school
- [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/): a music streaming app with a much simpler and cleaner UI than others, supposedly pays the artists more per stream(?)
- [Spark Email](https://sparkmailapp.com/): email client with a UI I just love

## Health

- [Lunette menstrual cup](https://store.lunette.com/): super soft and comfy for both lounging and exercising, chemical-free medical-grade silicone, never have to buy pads/tampons, only have to empty it every 8 hours, cost-effective and eco-friendly in the long run (saves over $100/year by not buying disposable products and I've had mine since 2017!)
- [Thinx period underwear](https://www.thinx.com/): also super soft and comfy, cost-effective and eco-friendly in the long run, a reasonable amount of absorption capacity, a nice backup for when I don't have my menstrual cup handy or an alternative on light days
